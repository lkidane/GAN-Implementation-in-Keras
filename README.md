# GAN-Implementation-in-Keras
Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are some of the most potent tools a machine learning practitioner can use.
GANs are capable of doing everything from super-resolution in images, to image translation, to facial manipulation, to medicine creation, to much, much more.

Basically implementation of a fully-connected GAN (FCGAN) for MNIST, then later improving that into a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) for a class of CIFAR-10.
